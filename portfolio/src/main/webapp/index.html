      <h3>My projects</h3>
      <p>The most impactful personal project I did is the Telegram bot for high school students that helps students to prepare for their final exams.
        Bot sends tasks to a user, which they solve and bot immediately checks if the answer is correct.
        It has a rich task database gathered from the previous exams, so the level of difficulty and the relevance is the best possible. I'm proud that it is used by
        students here in Ukraine, and despite a tough competition it still has well over 600 active users. 
        The bot is written in Java, uses MySQL as a database and deployed to RaspberryPi in my room :) The link to the bot is @Zno_helper_bot (the interface is in Ukrainian)

        During my study at school I liked doing 2D games, I used SFML and C++ for developing. The one I like the most is Tetris, you can find it on my Github
        <a href="https://github.com/PaulKovalov/tetrisv2.0" target="_blank">here</a>. I also have a few unfinished games such as Agario, Pentago, and drag racing simulator.

      <h3>My life</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I started coding when I was studying in school and immediately loved it. Since then I took part in many contests and tournaments in competitive programming,
          sometimes even won prizes :) so I definitely knew who I want to become. Now I am a second-year student at V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University on faculty of math.

            <p>My uni</p>
          </div>
          My main subjects of study are computer science, math, and algorithms. After the first year at uni, I started working at a local outsourcing IT company here in Kharkiv,
          as a part-time web developer, doing mostly backend tasks in Python3. This was my first experience doing commercial coding!
          Apart from programming, I like playing chess, table tennis, and cycling. Cycling is my greatest hobby, I love riding on big distances breaking my distance records, as well 
          as discovering the beautiful sceneries of my motherland. My longest ride so far is 106km, though I'm going to beat it soon with at least 150km in one ride! Below are a few photos
          taken from my trips. Sometimes we get into mud or use broken bridges with holes to cross the rivers but overall I find cycling is a fantastic experience!
        </p>
        <p>UPD 01/08/2020 The distance record is beaten and is now 160,7km, took a ride to a neighboring region's biggest city - Poltava</p>
